# Bounty Board
A beginner-friendly React app for creating and showcasing dynamic wanted posters inspired by classic bounty boards.

## Problem Story
Imagine you are a web developer in a Wild West town where the sheriff needs help tracking down some bad guys. Instead of hand-drawing wanted posters, the sheriff wants a quick and fun way to create them and post them online for the whole town to see.

As a tech student looking to earn some extra cash, your goal is to build a React app that creates wanted posters instantly and displays them in a public gallery. If the app is easy to use and looks great, you land the job at $50 per hour (you will need this).

## Features
- Create custom Wild West wanted posters
- Live poster preview while editing
- Upload an image for each outlaw
- Download posters as images
- Save posters to a public gallery
- Delete posters from the gallery
- Gallery data persists using localStorage 

## Technologies Used
- React
- JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS

## How to Run
